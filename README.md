# Letter_recognition_using_SVM

This Project tries to build a machine learning model using Support Vector machine for handwritten letter Recognition.

## Results For Linear SVM
  - Accuracy: 96.9%
  - precision: 96.9%
  - recall: 96.9%

## Results of Non-linear SVM:
  - Accuracy: 94.7%
  - precision: 94.8%
  - Recall: 94.7%
 
## Conclusion:
  - As it turns out the score of the non-linear model is less compared to the linear model.
  - But from the Gamma plot, we can see that if we decrease the gamma value (non-linearity) very low, then the performance of the model also decreases.
  - Overall, due the curvelinear nature of the given data (Handwriting), a non-linear model would be more suitable, as it too has a respectable accuracy of 95%.
